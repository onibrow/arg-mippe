# Transimpedance Amplifier

One of the key applications for a transimpedance amplifier is the readout of a photodiode. The group has looked into using our printed photodiodes in a pulse oximetry setup - meaningful data can only be drawn from [PPG measurements exceeding 60Hz ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8704947).
